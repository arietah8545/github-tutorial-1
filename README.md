## Git vs. GitHub
##### The difference between **Git vs. GitHub**:  
**Git** keeps snapshots/files of your code as a checkpoint of where you are. Having different versions would be useful because you may mess up your code, and you would be able to go back to the latest version. Git can also be known as a version control while **Github** would be the host for the repository. This means that the code is stored.
